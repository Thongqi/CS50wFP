No worries about tipping in Malaysia! Tipping in Malaysia is generally considered a gesture of appreciation rather than an obligation. Malaysians are pretty chill about it. If you're feeling generous or had a stellar experience, go ahead and show some love with a tip. But if you're low on cash or just not feeling it, no one's going to throw you side-eye. Just remember to smile and say "terima kasih" (thank you) â€“ that's the universal currency of gratitude here!
